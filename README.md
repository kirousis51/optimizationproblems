# Optimization Constants in Mathematics

A curated collection of optimization constants $C$ in mathematics, often arising from solving a variational problem, or finding the best constant in a functional inequality.  This repository is focused on recording the best known upper and lower bounds on such constants, and encourages crowdsourced contributions and updates (see [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute).

## List of Constants

We are arbitrarily numbering the constants as $C_1$, $C_2$, etc. based on the order in which the constants were added to the repository.
