# GL_2 Ramanujan conjecture exponent

## Description of constant
We define $C_{56} = \delta_2$ to be the smallest real number $\delta \ge 0$ such that the following uniform bound toward the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture holds.

> (**Hypothesis $H_2(\delta)$, specialization of [BB2011]**) For every number field $F$, every cuspidal automorphic representation $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb A_F)$ with unitary central character, and every place $v$ of $F$, the local component $\pi_v$ is "$\delta$-tempered".

One convenient way to quantify "$\delta$-tempered" is via the Langlands classification. Write the (generic, unitary) representation $\pi_v$ as a parabolic induction
$$
\pi_v \simeq \operatorname{Ind}\bigl(\tau_1|\det|^{\sigma_1}\,\otimes\,\tau_2|\det|^{\sigma_2}\bigr)
$$
with $\tau_1,\tau_2$ tempered and real exponents $\sigma_1 \ge \sigma_2$. Set
$$
m(\pi,v) := \max(|\sigma_1|,|\sigma_2|) = \sigma_1.
$$
Then $H_2(\delta)$ is the assertion that $m(\pi,v)\le \delta$ for all $\pi,v$, and $\delta_2$ is the infimum of admissible $\delta$.

At an unramified finite place $v$ with residue field size $N(v)$, the representation $\pi_v$ has Satake parameters $\{\alpha_v,\beta_v\}$ with $|\alpha_v\beta_v|=1$ and
$$
|\alpha_v| = N(v)^{t_v},\qquad |\beta_v| = N(v)^{-t_v}
$$
for some $t_v\in[0,\tfrac12]$. In this case $m(\pi,v)=t_v$, so $t_v\le \delta_2$ is equivalent to
$$
|\alpha_v|,|\beta_v| \le N(v)^{\delta_2}.
$$
Equivalently, the Hecke eigenvalue $\lambda_v := \alpha_v+\beta_v$ satisfies
$$
|\lambda_v| \le N(v)^{\delta_2}+N(v)^{-\delta_2}\le 2N(v)^{\delta_2}.
$$
In the classical language of Hecke–Maass newforms (over $\mathbb Q$), this corresponds to bounds of the shape
$$
|\lambda_f(n)| \ll_{\varepsilon,f} d(n)\,n^{\delta_2+\varepsilon},
$$
where $d(n)$ is the divisor function.

Conjecturally (and implied by the Langlands functoriality conjectures), one has $\delta_2=0$.

## Known upper bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $\tfrac12$ | [JS1981] | “Trivial” bound coming from Rankin–Selberg theory / unitarity; holds in general rank as $H_n(\tfrac12)$ [BB2011]. |
| $\tfrac12-\tfrac{1}{2^2+1}=\tfrac{3}{10}=0.3$ | [LRS1999] (ramified extension: [MS2004]) | Specialization of the Luo–Rudnick–Sarnak bound $\delta_n\le \tfrac12-\tfrac{1}{n^2+1}$ to $n=2$; extended to ramified places by Müller–Speh. |
| $\tfrac19\approx 0.11111$ | [KiSh2002] | Bound obtained from functoriality results for low symmetric powers (often stated for unramified places; see discussion in [Sar2005]). |
| $\tfrac{7}{64}=0.109375$ | [KS2003] (over $\mathbb Q$), extended uniformly to all number fields by [BB2011] | **Best known general bound.** In Sarnak’s notation, this controls both finite-place Satake parameters and archimedean spectral parameters for $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb A_{\mathbb Q})$ (and Blomer–Brumley extend it to arbitrary number fields). |

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |

## Additional comments and links

- **Relation to Selberg's $\tfrac14$ eigenvalue conjecture.**  For weight $0$ Maaß cusp forms for congruence subgroups, the archimedean parameter bound $m(\pi,\infty)\le \theta$ implies a spectral gap
    $$
    \lambda_1 \ge \tfrac14-\theta^2.
    $$
    In particular, $\theta=\tfrac{7}{64}$ yields
    $$
    \lambda_1 \ge \tfrac14-\bigl(\tfrac{7}{64}\bigr)^2 = \tfrac{975}{4096}\approx 0.238037\ldots
    $$
    see [Sar2005] and also [Li2006] for this numerical value.

- **Holomorphic forms.**  For classical holomorphic cusp forms on $\mathrm{GL}_2/\mathbb Q$ (i.e. $\pi_\infty$ holomorphic discrete series), the full Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture is known ($\delta=0$), by Deligne (and Deligne–Serre in weight 1); see [Sar2005] for a discussion.

- **Unramified vs. ramified places.**  Many "toward Ramanujan" bounds are first proved for unramified places; extending the same exponent to ramified places can require additional input.  See the discussion around Hypothesis $H_n(\delta)$ in [BB2011] and the remarks in [Sar2005].

- **Terminology.**  In analytic number theory, $\delta_2$ is often denoted by $\theta$ and referred to as "the (best known) Ramanujan exponent for $\mathrm{GL}_2$".
