# Erdős maximum-term constant

## Description of constant

For any transcendental entire function $f(z)=\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n z^n$, define .
$$
M(r,f):=\max_{|z|=r}|f(z)|,
\qquad
\mu(r,f):=\max_{n\ge 0}|a_n|\,r^n.
$$
Following [Er1961], define
$$
\beta(f):=\liminf_{r\to\infty}\frac{\mu(r,f)}{M(r,f)}.
$$

We define $C_{51} = B$ to be the supremum of $\beta(f)$ over all transcendental entire functions $f$.

## Additional comments

- If polynomials were allowed, then $C_{51}=1$ (e.g. $f(z)=z+1$ gives $\mu(r,f)/M(r,f)\to 1$). The problem is interesting only in the transcendental class; this is the formulation used in [CH1964] and [HT2026].
- The quantity $\mu(r,f)/M(r,f)$ compares the size of the *largest single term* of the power series to the
  *maximum modulus* on $|z|=r$.  In general it can be quite small (e.g. for $f(z)=e^z$, one has $\mu(r,f)/M(r,f)\to 0$ as $r\to\infty$), but Erdős conjectured that it cannot be too small, and in particular that $\beta(f)\le 1/2$ for all transcendental entire $f$.  This was disproven by Kövári (unpublished), who showed that $\beta(f)$ can exceed $1/2$ for some transcendental entire function $f$.
- Clunie and Hayman [CH1964] constructed a specific transcendental entire function with $\beta(f)\ge 4/7$, and proved that this is the best possible using their construction.  The problem of determining the exact value of $C_{51}$  and the Erdős problem asks how large it can be in the **lim inf** sense.

- The Clunie–Hayman lower bound $4/7$ is based on constructing a bilateral Laurent series $k$ satisfying a functional equation (“scaling identity”),
  then truncating it to an entire function $f$. The scaling identity allows one to compute $M(r,k)$ exactly on a geometric sequence of radii $r=K^m$,
  and hence relate $\beta(f)$ to $\max_{|z|=1}|k(z)|$ [CH1964].

- He and Tang [HT2026] generalize this to a **two-parameter family** $f_{K,\varepsilon}$ (scale $K>1$ and unimodular phase $|\varepsilon|=1$),
  prove an exact identity of the form
  $$
  \beta(f_{K,\varepsilon})=\frac{1}{\max_{|z|=1}|k_{K,\varepsilon}(z)|},
  $$
  and then certify a specific choice of $(K,\varepsilon)$ giving $\beta>0.58507$ via ball arithmetic.

- This problem is catalogued as **Erdős Problem #513** (see [EP513]).
