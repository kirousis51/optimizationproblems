# The *putative* complexity threshold of random 3SAT

## Description of constant

Let $m,n$ be positive integers and let $V$ be a set of $n$ Boolean variables. By a random 3SAT formula of density $m/n$, we mean a collection of $m$ clauses selected u.a.r. with replacement from the set of $8{{n}\choose{3}}$ clauses on three distinct variables from $V$.   

It is conjectured, and corroborated by experimental results (see e.g. [LT1992]) and non-rigorous considerations of Statistical Physics (see e.g. [MZ1997]), that there is a constant $r_3 \approx 4.2$, here to be denoted also by $C_{52}$, such that for random instances of 3SAT with constant density $r =m/n$  we have that    
$$\mbox{if } r > r_3, \mbox{ then } \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\Pr[ \phi \mbox{ is satisfiable}] =0,$$ 
whereas
$$\mbox{if } r < r_3, \mbox{ then } \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\Pr[ \phi \mbox{ is satisfiable}] =1.$$

It has been proved by Friedgut [F1999] that there is a bounded sequence $r_{3,n}$ such that
$$\mbox{if } r > \limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty} r_{3,n}, \mbox{ then } \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\Pr[ \phi \mbox{ is satisfiable}] =0,$$
whereas 
$$\mbox{if } r < \liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} r_{3,n}, \mbox{ then } \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\Pr[ \phi \mbox{ is satisfiable}] =1.$$

Below we give the rigorously proved  upper bounds for $\limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty} r_{3,n}$ and the rigorously proved   lower bounds for 
$\liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} r_{3,n}$
