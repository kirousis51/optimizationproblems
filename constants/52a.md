# The complexity threshold of random 3-SAT

## Description of constant

Let $m,n$ be positive integers and let $V$ be a set of $n$ Boolean variables. By a random formula of density $r= m/n$, we mean a collection of $m$ clauses selected u.a.r. with replacement from the set of $8{{n}\choose{3}}$ clauses on three distinct variables from $V$. For linguistic convenience, formulas with variables from $V$ will be called $n$-formulas.

It is conjectured, and corroborated by experimental results (see e.g. [LT1992]) and non-rigorous considerations of Statistical Physics (see e.g. [MZ1997]), that there is a constant $r_3 \approx 4.2$, here to be denoted also by $C_{52}$, such that for any constant $r$:
$$\text{if } r > r_3, \text{ then } \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\Pr[\text{an } n\text{-formula with density } r  \text{ is satisfiable}] =0,$$
whereas
$$\text{if } r < r_3, \text{ then } \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\Pr[\text{an } n\text{-formula with density } r \text{ is satisfiable}] =1.$$

It has been proved by Friedgut [F1999] that there is a sequence $r_{3,n}, n=1, \dots$ such that for any $\epsilon>0$
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\Pr[
\text{an } n\text{-formula with density } \geq (r_{3,n} + \epsilon)  \text{ is satisfiable}] =0,$$
whereas
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\Pr[
\text{an } n\text{-formula with density } \leq (r_{3,n} -\epsilon)  \text{ is satisfiable}] =1.$$

Below we give the rigorously proved  upper bounds for $\limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty} r_{3,n}$ and the rigorously proved   lower bounds for
$\liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} r_{3,n}.$

## Additional comments
1. The extra hypothesis used in [MS2008] is about the satisfying assignments of formulas with density below and close to the threshold. 

2. In [CF1986], the probability of satisfiability is shown to be only a positive constant. However, this, by Friedgut's result of 1999, implies that the probability is actually 1.
