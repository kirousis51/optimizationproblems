# Contributing Guidelines

## How to Contribute

### Adding a New Constant

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your contribution
2. **Create a new file** in the `constants/` directory as `<name>.md`, where `<name>` is some unique name for your constant.
3. **Use the template**: Copy the structure from [template.md](template.md)
4. **Fill in sections**:
   - Provide a clear definition of the constant (call it $C$)
   - Include the current best known bounds with citations
   - Incomplete submissions are welcome; just provide as much information as you have.
5. **Submit a pull request**
6. If approved, I will assign it a number and link to it from the main README.

### Updating Existing Bounds

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch
2. **Edit the relevant constant file**:
   - Update the bounds section with new values, with at least one citation or reference
3. **Submit a pull request**
